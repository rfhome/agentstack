# AgentStack — Feature Status

## Shipped

### Core fitness loop

- [x] Lens (Gemini 2.5 Flash) — recovery, longevity, Oura + Fitbit context
- [x] Nexus (Claude Sonnet) — synthesis + agent-suggested session rating (A/B/C) with one-line reason
- [x] All agent logs stored per session; robust JSON fence extraction prevents parse failures
- [x] Suggested rating shown after analysis — user can accept or override before it's saved

### Auth
- [x] Email + password sign-up / sign-in
- [x] Google OAuth sign-in
- [x] All data scoped to authenticated user

### Wearables
- [x] Oura Ring OAuth 2.0 — readiness, HRV, sleep score, deep/REM sleep, temperature deviation
- [x] Fitbit via Google Fit API — avg/max HR, active minutes, heart points (AZM), steps
- [x] Both injected into agent context on every analysis
- [x] Wearable status and data visible on Settings page

### History & progress
- [x] Session history page (/fitness/sessions) — expandable cards with exercises, Nexus synthesis, per-agent accordion

- [x] Analyzed / Not analyzed badge on session cards
- [x] Session cards show AZM alongside duration and avg HR in the summary row
- [x] Cardio activities (machine, HR, duration, distance, calories) shown in expanded session view

### Profile & goals
- [x] Profile editor (/profile) — edit name and full training context markdown
- [x] Goals tracker — target weight/reps per exercise, mark achieved

### UX / mobile

- [x] Fitbit fill button fills HR, AZM, and duration from today's Google Fit data in one tap
- [x] Cardio machine photo analysis — upload treadmill/bike/rower screenshot; Lens extracts duration, distance, HR, calories and auto-populates the form

### Deployment

## Backlog

### Near-term

### Medium-term
- [ ] **ChatGPT conversation import** — parse ChatGPT data export to seed historical session records
- [ ] **Apple Health integration** — for richer iOS data (HRV, VO2 max, sleep stages) beyond what Google Fit surfaces
- [ ] **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security** — DB-level user isolation as a second enforcement layer
- [ ] **Invite / multi-user** — allow a second user (e.g. trainer) to view read-only

### Productization (Phase 1 — Onboarding)
- [x] **Structured onboarding wizard** — 9-step guided setup (goal, experience, split, gym, injuries, activities) with back-nav and progress bar; pre-populates on re-run from existing programConfig
- [x] **AI-generated program structure** — Nexus/Claude generates full markdown coaching profile; `deriveProgramConfig()` maps answers to a typed `ProgramConfig` with `cycleStructure`; review step shows generated cycle days before confirmation
- [x] **Gym/equipment setup** — gym type stored in `programConfig.gymType`; supports commercial, Planet Fitness, home gym, bodyweight; coaching profile includes equipment constraints
- [x] **Dynamic cycle days** — log page fetches `programConfig.cycleStructure` on mount; cycle selector and template button reflect actual user program (falls back to Push/Pull/Legs/Arms)
- [x] **`onboardingComplete` flag** — UserProfile schema; fitness page banner uses it; existing users with profiles already marked as completed
- [x] **Wearable setup UX** — guided OAuth flow in onboarding wizard (connect Oura / Fitbit after review step); gated behind `tier !== "free"`

### Productization (Phase 2 — Retention)
- [x] **Streaks card** — `StreaksCard` on fitness dashboard: current week streak, this-week vs last-week delta, total sessions, goals achieved; computed by `computeStreaks()` in `src/lib/streaks.ts`; `GET /api/stats` returns stats
- [x] **Weekly summary** — `WeeklySummary` client component on fitness dashboard; `POST /api/weekly-summary` calls Nexus (Claude Sonnet) with this/prev week sessions + Oura recovery data; stored as `domain="weekly"` Recommendation; user triggers on demand; uses `extractJSON` + `wrapAgentInput` + `SECURITY_CANARY`
- [x] **Progress page enhancements** — workout frequency heatmap (52-week GitHub-style grid), personal records summary (all-time max weight per exercise), weight-over-time charts; `GET /api/progress` now returns `{ exercises, prs, trainingDays }`
- [x] **Access tiers + promo codes** — `User.tier` (`free`/`beta`/`premium`), `PromoCode` model, `POST /api/redeem`, tier badge + redeem UI on Settings; create codes via Railway SQL
- [x] **Multi-user readiness** — no hardcoded user assumptions; new credential signups redirect to `/onboarding`; empty states handled across all dashboard components; data fully scoped by `userId`
- [x] **Wearable setup step in onboarding** — guided OAuth connect buttons for Oura / Fitbit after the review step; gated behind `tier !== "free"`
- [x] **Recovery trend chart** — Oura 28-day readiness + sleep score line chart plus HRV chart on `/fitness/progress`; fixed Oura API v2 field name (`day` not `date`)
- [ ] **Notifications / digest** — "Your next workout is tomorrow — here's what Forge prescribes" as email or push

### Phase 3 — Beyond fitness
- [ ] Finance domain (portfolio tracking, Roth conversion planning, retirement modeling)
- [ ] Health domain (supplement tracking, lab results, longevity scoring)
- [ ] Work domain (project milestones, focus tracking)
- [ ] Cross-domain Nexus signals — poor sleep flagged in both fitness recovery AND work focus
- [ ] Weekly digest email
